  <p>India has an asymmetric federal government, with elected officials at the federal, 
      state and local levels. At the national level, the head of government, Prime Minister, 
      is elected by members of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the parliament of India.
      The elections are conducted by the Election Commission of India. All members of the Lok Sabha,
      except two who can be nominated by the President of India, are directly elected through general
      elections which take place every five years, in normal circumstances, by universal adult suffrage 
      and a first-past-the-post system.Members of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament,
      are elected by elected members of the legislative assemblies of the states and the Electoral college 
      for the Union Territories of India.</p>
